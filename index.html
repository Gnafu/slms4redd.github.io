        <p>The information contained in this page are standard guidelines for a UNREDD Portal. Every portal that will be built within the UNREDD Initiative has to consider them at making layout and graphics related decisions.</p>

<p>Customers' related requirements have to be considered, discussed with the team and documented in order to keep track of the reasons.</p>

<p>A Portal <strong>can</strong> have:</p>

<ul>
<li>an introductory pop up that can be used to introduce the country, the National UNREDD or REDD+ project related initiatives or other related activities already under going in the country;</li>
<li>information buttons whether required to present additional information about the various data and features available on the portal.</li>
</ul>

<p>A Portal <strong>has</strong> to have:</p>

<ul>
<li>a header made of a banner aimed to host national flag, logos / flags of local authorities involved in the initiative, UNREDD logo;</li>
<li>a footer for providing national or project information as well as utilities to be used by the end users - e.g. SLMS mailing list to post a question or get answers from others;</li>
<li>a toolbar to be used to host the languages selection buttons, the feedback facility, the time series slider for showing time related changes to the selected layers;</li>
<li>a legend section to make it easier the analyses of the selected layers;</li>
<li>a section to show the available layers, activate or deactivate them;</li>
<li>zoom in and out buttons;</li>
<li>One transparency slider for each layer</li>
</ul>

<p>Best practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>layers with a simple legend (only one symbol, i.e. country boundaries) should have a small legend next to the layer label</li>
</ul>
