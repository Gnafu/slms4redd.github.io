### How to use these pages

* Jekyll and Markdown support are disabled
* put your html/css files where they should stay but DON'T touch the doc folder
* The doc folder is reserved for the HTML pages generated by [this](https://github.com/slms4redd/slms-documentation) documentation. Please commit only the changed pages and only after having generated them with sphinx. No manual modification in the doc folder.

TODO: deploy the documentation using Travis see this -> https://github.com/Syntaf/travis-sphinx
