UNREDD flows
=========================

According to what is specified in a previous chapter, the UNREDD NMFS system uses three GeoBatch flows: *ingestion*, *reprocess*, *publish*.

These flows interact with other processes (DBMS) and webapps (GeoServer, GeoStore), and needs some I/O on the local filesytem.
The details about the webapps connections, about the directory locations on the filesystem and other peers can be configured in the flow definition files.
